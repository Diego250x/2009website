Minecraft Bedrock, also known as Minecraft: Bedrock Edition or simply Bedrock, is a version of the Minecraft video game that is developed and distributed by Mojang Studios. Unlike the original version of Minecraft, known as Minecraft Java Edition, Bedrock is designed to be cross-platform and is available on a variety of platforms, including Windows 10, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, mobile (iOS and Android), and virtual reality.
<br><br>
The main feature of Minecraft Bedrock is its ability to allow cross-play between different platforms. This means Bedrock players can play together in the same world, regardless of what platform they're playing on. For example, a player on a mobile device can play with another player on an Xbox or Windows 10 PC.
<br><br>
Another notable difference from Minecraft Bedrock is that it uses the Bedrock game engine, which offers performance improvements and optimization compared to the Java Edition version. Additionally, Bedrock has introduced exclusive features such as the Minecraft Marketplace where players can purchase and download additional content such as maps, skins, and texture packs.
<br><br>
While the Bedrock Edition offers a similar gaming experience to the Java Edition in terms of building, exploration, and adventure, there are some differences in gameplay mechanics and the availability of mods and modifications. The mods in Bedrock are often called "add-ons" and are more limited compared to the more extensive and customizable mods in the Java Edition.
<br><br>
In short, Minecraft Bedrock is a cross-platform version of the game that allows players on different devices to play together in the same world, with features and gameplay mechanics tailored to deliver a consistent experience across all supported platforms.<br><br>
